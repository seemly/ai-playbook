## 0. Purpose and Scope
### Purpose
- Define the canonical entry point for language-specific coding standards.
- Provide consistent expectations for AI-assisted changes across languages.
- Keep standards modular so each language can evolve independently.

### Scope
- Applies to WordPress theme, plugin, and block development work.
- Applies to any AI-assisted change that touches PHP, JS/TS, or CSS.
- Supplements [AI Playbook](AI_PLAYBOOK.md) and the [WordPress overlay](AI_PLAYBOOK_WORDPRESS.md).

## 1. How to Use
- Start here to find the correct language standard.
- Follow the most specific document available for the file you are editing.
- If a rule conflicts with repo policy, repo policy takes precedence.
- If a rule is missing, stop and request guidance before proceeding.
- Use the [WordPress overlay](AI_PLAYBOOK_WORDPRESS.md) for stack-specific rules.

## 2. Document Map
- PHP: [AI Coding Standards (PHP)](AI_PLAYBOOK_CODING_STANDARDS_PHP.md)
- JS/TS: [AI Coding Standards (JS/TS)](AI_PLAYBOOK_CODING_STANDARDS_JS.md)
- CSS: [AI Coding Standards (CSS)](AI_PLAYBOOK_CODING_STANDARDS_CSS.md)
- WordPress: [AI Coding Standards (WordPress)](AI_PLAYBOOK_CODING_STANDARDS_WORDPRESS.md)

## 3. Governance
- Owners are responsible for approving updates and resolving conflicts.
- Update cadence should align with major WordPress or tooling changes.
- Significant changes must be recorded with rationale and reviewed.
- The WordPress playbook should link to the latest version of each standard.
